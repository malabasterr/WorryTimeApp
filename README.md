# What is the Worry Time App?

The Worry Time App is a mental wellbeing tool designed to help individuals manage anxiety by organising their worries. This app allows users to jot down their worries throughout the day, which are saved to a hidden list. At a self-determined time, referred to as "worry time," users are guided to review their list of worries one by one, addressing and clearing them in a more composed state of mind. This method is based on a proven anxiety-management technique, encouraging individuals to acknowledge their worries by writing them down and setting them aside until they are better equipped to process them.
