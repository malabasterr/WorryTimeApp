### Get started

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Start the app
   npx expo start

# Must Do

# MADDY NEXT TIME YOU OPEN THE APP SET THE CLOCK SCREEN TO LIKE 11PM AND 5MINS

At the moment, when the saved time is reached (between then and midnight), when the user tries to access the 'clock' it navigates them to the start-worry-time page.
The redirection also needs to also be added to the homepage, but only when other elements are in place

Timer has been added to list screen which then has a home button when it is done. The timer now needs to take the saved duration from the clock screen and use this.

- If person clears all of their worries, navigate to appropraite cleared screen and delete any remaining worries.
- Add edge case for if a user does not input any worries at all

# Good to Do

- Set it so when first opening the app the user has to select a time
