### Get started

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Start the app
   npx expo start

# Must Do

- Add edge case for if a user does not input any worries at all
- Notification when worry time starts (and any other notifcations deemed neccessary)

At the moment, when the saved time is reached (between then and midnight), when the user tries to access the 'clock' it navigates them to the start-worry-time page.
The redirection also needs to also be added to the homepage, but only when other elements are in place

### Last stages
- Remove buttons from homepage and list page that are for development only

# Good to Do

- Set it so when first opening the app the user has to select a time
