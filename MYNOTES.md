### Get started

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Start the app
   npx expo start

# Must Do

- Add edge case for if a user does not input any worries at all
- Notification when worry time starts (and any other notifcations deemed neccessary)

When safe to do so, clear redirect logic from clock.js page

### Last stages
- Remove buttons from homepage and list page that are for development only

# Good to Do

- Set it so when first opening the app the user has to select a time
