### Get started

# Must Do

At the moment, when the saved time is reached (between then and midnight), when the user tries to access the 'clock' it navigates them to the start-worry-time page.
The redirection also needs to also be added to the homepage, but only when other elements are in place

- If person clears all of their worries, navigate to appropraite cleared screen and delete any remaining worries.
- Add edge case for if a user does not input any worries at all

# Good to Do

- Set it so when first opening the app the user has to select a time
