### Get started

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Start the app
   npx expo start

# Must Do

At the moment, when the saved time is reached, when the user tries to access the 'clock' it navigates them to the Start page.
Once the time is working, the redirection needs to also be added to the homepage.

- Timer added to list screen
- When timer finishes, navigate to appropraite cleared/not cleared screen and delete any remaining worries
- Add edge case for if a user does not input any worries at all

# Good to Do

- Set it so when first opening the app the user has to select a time
